<p align="justify">Mesh4all is dedicated to maintaining open-source software and hardware directories with appropriate documentation in multiple languages. To guarantee access to resilient, persistent mesh networks worldwide. We will also be tasked with disseminating the technology among faculty, students and businesses in developing nations where accessibility to the internet is limited and non-existent.
</p>

<p align="justify">The mesh we are working on will be known as Mesh4(M4): join, use, speak, send, pay, mesh4all!</p>

<p align="justify">Our main purpose is to expand web accessibility to users worldwide via an open-source repository for Mesh software and hardware for M4, via unfettered, resilient connectivity to a open mesh through devices of all kind proprietary, open and DIY. We will contribute towards the adoption of M4 and its devices.   
</p>
<p align="justify">Our Mission is to expand the mesh, M4,  for any and all peoples and organizations in a permissionless manner via our open source software and hardware community run repositories. We will also actively invest any proceeds into hardware research and code/functionality that run on the mesh.</p>

<p align="justify">Our Vision is a worldwide mesh network that can be easily accessed by anyone at very low cost or no cost at all with low energy consumption open hardware devices.</p>   

<p align="justify">We Value the ability for anyone to communicate,  transact, and participate in a network without having a centralised entity acting as a gatekeeper for approval. MESH4ALL!
